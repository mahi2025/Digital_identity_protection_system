# Overview

In today’s digital age, AI-generated impersonations and personal data leaks are increasingly frequent, threatening individuals' privacy and security. This project provides a comprehensive, Ethiopian-focused platform that detects personal data leaks on social media, identifies AI-based impersonation attempts, and leverages the Fayda National ID system for robust identity verification.

Starting with social media monitoring and evolving to sophisticated AI impersonation detection and official ID integration, this system empowers citizens, influencers, and public figures to effectively safeguard their digital identity and reputation.

# Problem Statement

- Personal data leaks on social media expose individuals to fraud, scams, and identity theft.

- AI technologies enable deepfake videos, cloned voices, and fake accounts that impersonate users convincingly.

- Traditional verification methods relying on name, email, or phone are easily bypassed by impersonators.

- Ethiopia lacks a tailored system that integrates national identity verification with AI-driven impersonation detection.

- Citizens and public figures need a reliable, privacy-respecting system that detects and alerts identity threats early.

# Key Features

### Phase 1 – SOCMINT Leak Detection

- Monitor public mentions of your name, phone, email, or brand on social media platforms: Facebook.
- Real-time alerts on suspicious data exposure.

### Phase 2 – Fayda National ID Integration

- One-time National ID submission as root identity verification.

- Cross-verification with official government databases to confirm authenticity and linked contact details.

- Flagging and alerting of mismatched identity claims to prevent impersonation.

- Optional biometric verification if API access permits.

- Monitoring for leaked ID data in dark web sources.

- Secure, encrypted storage of identity data adhering to privacy best practices.

### Phase 3 – AI Impersonation Protection

- Detect fake social media accounts using your photos or name.

- Identify AI-generated deepfake videos and cloned voices through advanced audio-visual analysis.

- Continuous monitoring and a user-friendly threat dashboard.

## Demo

## Installation & Setup

### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-identity-protection.git
cd digital-identity-protection

### Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac  
.\venv\Scripts\activate # Windows  
pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Configure environment variables (API keys, database URI, Fayda ID API credentials) in .env file.

### Initialize the database:

### Run backend server:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

### Start frontend dashboard (React/Next.js):

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+

- Node.js 14+ and npm

- PostgreSQL or MongoDB database

- Access to social media APIs (Facebook)

- Fayda National ID API

- Basic knowledge of Docker (optional for containerized deployment)

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data, including National ID details, is stored encrypted using AES-256.

- Secure API endpoints with OAuth2 / JWT authentication.

- Privacy-by-design ensures user data is never shared without explicit consent.

- Two-factor verification during FAN number submission prevents unauthorized account creation.

- Regular audits and logging for suspicious activities.

- Compliance with Ethiopian data protection laws and international privacy standards.
